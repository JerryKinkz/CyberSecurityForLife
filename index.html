        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
          These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information,
          extorting money from users via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
          Now the Types of Cybersecurity threats are...

          <h2>Phishing</h2>
          <p>Phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source.
             It is usually performed through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or 
             to install malware on the victim's machine. Phishing is a common type of cyber attack that everyone should learn about
              in order to protect against email threats.</p>

          <h2>Social engineering</h2>
          <p>Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can 
            solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of
             the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.</p>

          <h2>Ransomware</h2>
          <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software or malware. It encrypts a victim's data, after which the attacker demands a ransom. 
            Once the ransom is paid, the attacker sends a decryption key to restore access to the victim's data. The ransom can range from a 
            few hundred dollars to millions of dollars. Typically, payment is demanded in the form of a cryptocurrency, such as bitcoins.</p>

          <h2>Malware</h2>
          <p>Malware is intrusive software that is designed to damage and destroy computers and computer systems. Malware is a contraction for 
            “malicious software.” Examples of common malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware.</p>

            <p>Application security is all about keeping software applications impervious to threats. While this is a large focus of companies that
             develop and sell their applications and cloud services, its also important for businesses.Misconfiguration of security settings is a major 
             reason for cloud account data breaches.</p>

            <h1>INFORMATION SECURITY</h1>
            
            <p>Information security covers the protection of company data and the data that you collect from customers or clients.
              Most companies will need to adhere to one or more information security standards. These standards can have stiff penalties
               should negligence result in the compromise of personally identifiable information.Cyber security companies will look at how 
               you collect, store, and transmit data. They will put protections in place to ensure that data is encrypted as needed, and protected from being breached.

            <h1>NETWORK SECURITY</h1>
            
            <p>Network security involves protecting your physical network and all the devices connected to it. Most companies use firewalls to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic
               for threats. Securing your wireless network and ensuring any remote connections happen through encrypted methods are also ways that cyber security services ensure
                network security.Network security is designed to ensure that only authorized users gain access to the network, and that no suspicious behaviours are happening inside
                 the network that would indicate a breach.</p>

            <h1>END-USER SECURITY</h1>
            
            <p>End-user security is also known as end-point security. This refers to protecting the devices that users work with, and users themselves. End-user security is vital, since 91%
               of cyberattacks begin with a phishing email.Another important piece of end-user security, beyond device protection, is employee security awareness training. Employees must be
                trained regularly on how to detect phishing emails, password security, handling sensitive data, and other important cyber hygiene basics.</p>

            <p>Operational security involves taking a step back and looking at your entire security strategy as a whole to ensure that all security tactics are working in unison throughout your operations,
               and that none are in conflict with one another. It guarantees that the operation as a whole is not only securing all areas of a potential breach, but also regularly updating its security
               strategies to keep up with the latest threats and security advances.</p>

        <p>Cyber security is one of the most important aspects of the fast-paced growing digital world.
           The threats of it are hard to deny, so it is crucial to learn how to defend from them and teach
            others how to do it too.The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against
